## Geometric Tools For Computer Graphics
# Lab assignments of the subject + the final exam

In our case, the mark was weird:
-> if you had AT MOST 1 out of 6 failed assignments, the Homework mark was the sum of all marks divided by 6
-> otherwise, max(Final, 0.5Final + 0.5Hw)
I write that down to prevent surprises towards future students who come here to find "inspiration" or resources.

I also left exercise samples (IN CATALAN, from a degree subject named Computational Geometry [GEOC]), and the final from my year (solved) and last year (sadly, unsolved).

Marks per lab:
1 -> 9.3 : the cube down could've been better
2 -> 7.8 : janky rotation; extra mark was added if I did extra features, which was implicitly on the statement
3 -> 1.9 : not here, was really awful. How to solve it: doing it w/4 methods: coords sys change, Foley-Van Dam, Compact Formula and Quaternions
